# Pelias address deduplicator
A stream that performs address deduplication using the robust
[OpenVenues deduplicator](https://github.com/openvenues/address_deduper); note that it must be separately installed and
running.

## ðŸš¨ Notice: This package is deprecated

*Over time, the query-time deduplication features of [pelias/api](https://github.com/pelias/api)
have been improved to the point where this package is no longer needed.*

*While functional, the address deduplicator is quite difficult to run reliably. It often fails during
long imports, and even in the best cases dramatically reduces import speed.*

*It would take considerable work to improve this project to the point where it would be recommended
for general use with Pelias again, and we believe most deduplication problems can be solved in
importers or in the API.*

*If anyone has a particular need for this deduplicator and would like to maintain it, please reach
out by opening an issue in [pelias/pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias/)*


## API
`pelias-address-deduplicator` exports a single function:
`createDeduplicateStream( requestBatchSize, maxLiveRequests, serverUrl )`, which accepts three optional arguments:

  * `requestBatchSize` (default: `10000`): The number of addresses to buffer into a
    batch before sending it to the deduplicator. The higher the number, the
    less time and energy collectively spent in making requests, but the
    bigger the memory consumption buildup.
  * `maxLiveRequests` (default: `4`): Since the deduper is implemented as a
    standalone server and processes data more slowly than the importer feeds
    it, the stream needs to rate-limit itself. `maxLiveRequests` indicates
    the maximum number of unresolved concurrent requests at any time; when
    that number is hit, the stream will pause reading until the number of
    concurrent requests falls below it.
  * `serverUrl` (default: `'http://localhost:5000'`): The HTTP base URL of the address deduplicator server.

and returns a `Transform` stream, which accepts un-deduplicated addresses and filters out the duplicates; note that
it'll likely be the slowest part of your data pipeline because of all the involved heavy lifting. The addresses
themselves are expected to be [pelias/model](https://github.com/pelias/model) `Document` objects.
